This project classifies the input images into two classes: Real and AI-generated. The dataset was sourced from three different repositories: CIFAKE on Kaggle, a second Kaggle dataset of AI-generated images, and additional images obtained through web scraping. After data collection, the images were organized into a unified directory with two main subfolders: "Real," containing 51,254 real images, and "AIGenerated," containing 50,850 AI-generated images. The model was built using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with an accuracy of 92%. The model is deployed using Streamlit.
